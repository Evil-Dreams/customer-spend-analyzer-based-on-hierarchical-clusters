# Customer Spend Analysis using Hierarchical Clustering

This project analyzes customer spending patterns using hierarchical clustering to group customers with similar behavior. It helps businesses understand different customer segments and make better marketing and business decisions.

The dataset is cleaned and relevant features are selected before applying hierarchical clustering. A dendrogram is used to visualize the cluster formation and to decide the optimal number of clusters.

Python and Jupyter Notebook are used for implementation along with popular data analysis and machine learning libraries. The final output shows clearly separated customer groups based on spending behavior.

This project can be applied in customer segmentation, targeted marketing, loyalty programs, and revenue optimization.
